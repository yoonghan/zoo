I want to update the  announcement of the webpage. 
The way to do it is to update src/i18n/locales/*/translations.ts.
There is a announcements object, I need to update the text for english from "Panda exhibit is *CLOSED" to "Panda exhibit is *CLOSED, expected to reopen on October 2025.". 
Please help to update the announcements array and also update malay and chinese translation.
